# Subway_System_Analysis
New Yorkâ€™s subways are the only system in the world to operate around the clock and are extremely extensive. To have subways down for even a week causes an economic nightmare. Since the numbers of people travelling from subway are increasing day by day, it is necessary to identify and analyze the key factors so as to come up with a solution to improve the service. So, we would like to perform statistical analysis and visualize the NYC MTA turnstile data set to analyze the busy times on the stations and to come up with some solutions to enhance their services.
